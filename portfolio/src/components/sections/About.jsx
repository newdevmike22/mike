                        Hello <Emoji>ðŸ‘‹</Emoji>
                    </AboutHeading> 
                    <p>
                       I'm Mike, a front-end developer, graphic designer, and blogger
                       based in St. Louis, Missouri. I work with small businesses to assist 
                       them in developing and or growing their brands.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                       I am a creative thinking, well-organized, detail-oriented problem 
                       solver who enjoys helping others achieve their goals.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                      I am a family person who loves watching NFL, NBA, and NCAA football 
                      and basketball games. I also greatly enjoy Japanese anime, superhero 
                      and martial arts films/tv series, and reading Stephen King and Star 
                      Wars novels and self-help books.
